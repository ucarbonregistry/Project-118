# Project-118
1 MW Jiwa Small Hydro Electric Project in Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh
________________
PRIOR HISTORY:
The project activity is a small-scale hydro project, following are the key details under the prior history of the project:   
a) The project activity was applied under Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) of VERRA. At the time of initial registration, the project was registered with VCS under Markit Registry platform. However, the Markit Registry exited from the carbon operation and during this transition the project documents were not tracked and hence the project status is not visible under VCS (currently operated by VERRA).  
b) In this regard, the Project Proponent has already intimated to VERRA for reconfirming the status of VCS and ensuring the status it’s validity under VCS till end of crediting period allotted by VCS at the time of commissioning. However, it’s currently under process.  
c) Also, PP has checked and confirmed that after the completion of crediting period under VCS project shall not be renewed under VCS. Therefore once registered with UCR the project will not be active under any other GHG platform.  d) Additionally, the project has not been applied under any other GHG mechanism part from VCS; also for the current period of COUs, the VCS verification has not been initiated. Hence project will not cause double accounting of carbon credits (i.e. CoUs).
